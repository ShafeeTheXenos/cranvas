Description: This is an R package as the next generation of GGobi, a software
    package for interactive and dynamic statistical graphics. It includes most
    of features in GGobi such as brushing, zooming, panning, identifying and
    linking, as well as common types of statistical graphics, e.g. bar plot,
    scatter plot, boxplot, histogram, density plot, spine plot, parallel
    coordinates plot, mosaic plot, maps, missing value plot, time series plot,
    tour, scatter plot matrix, hexagons and tiles (color images), etc. Based on
    the support of several other packages, cranvas aims for speed (from Qt) and
    flexibility (from R), with the style and design borrowed from ggplot2.

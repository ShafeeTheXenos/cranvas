\title{Update the brush size in the mouse move event}
\usage{
update_brush_size(meta, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{meta}{the meta data containing the brush information (\code{meta$pos},
\code{meta$brush.size}, \code{meta$brush.move} and \code{meta$start})}

\item{event}{the event in the callback (if missing, it will search in the
parent environment \code{sys.frame(1)} which is often the callback
function)}
}
\value{
a matrix of the coordinates of the brush rectangle, which can be
  passed to \code{\link[qtbase]{qrect}} and used to query the brushed
  elements by \code{layer$locate()}; as a side effect, the brush size is
  updated, unless it is only a single click or the brush is not in the move
  mode
}
\description{
The brush size is changed by the differences in two successive mouse
positions.
}
\details{
The current mouse position is obtained from \code{event$pos()}. If the brush
is in the move mode (\code{meta$brush.move == TRUE}; often set in a mouse
click event), the brush size is updated by the differences between
\code{meta$start} and \code{meta$pos}; the former is the starting position of
the mouse, and the latter is the current position.

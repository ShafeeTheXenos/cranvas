\description{
The key press and release events often involve with setting the selection
mode of the \code{\link{brush}}, the alpha transparency, and deleting
selected elements, and so on. Mouse press, release, move and hover are often
related to brushing and identifying cases. These functions implement these
common processes.
}
\section{Mouse Events}{
  Left click to brush the plot with a rectangle brush, and
  right click to resize the brush (the cursor shape will
  become a cross).  The middle button is used to toggle
  between two types of brushes: one type is to keep the
  brush on the plot when the mouse is released, and the
  other type is to hide it on mouse release. When the mouse
  is released, the brush history will be saved
  (\code{\link{save_brush_history}}).
}

\section{Key Events}{
  The keys A, O, X, N and C corresponds to the selection
  mode AND, OR, XOR, NOT and COMPLEMENT respectively.

  Plus (+) and Minus (-) can increase or decrease the alpha
  transparency exponentially.

  The key Delete will make the selected elements invisible,
  and F5 makes all the elements visible.

  The question key (?) toggles the identify mode (on or
  off). The cross cursor shape (+) indicates it is in the
  identify mode, and a normal cursor indicates the brush
  mode.

  The key S acts like the middle button of the mouse
  (toggles between two brush types). The key Z toggles the
  zooming mode under the selection brush.

  In a key release event, we set the selection mode to
  \code{'none'}. If PageUp or PageDown is pressed (or
  equivalently use square brackets \samp{[} and \samp{]}),
  we show the brush history step by step.
